# Yet another dive log

Born out of dissatisfaction with the existing options.

Initial short/medium term goals:

- [ ] Import of Subsurface `ssrf` type files
- [ ] Display of dive log in list format
- [ ] Display single dive details
- [ ] Technical view: show all information we know from dive computer
- [ ] Add dive manually
- [ ] Import dives via libdivecomputer

Longer term goals

- [ ] Buhlman implementation for internal display of deco information
